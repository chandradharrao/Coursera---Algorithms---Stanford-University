.Iteratively make "myopic".irrevocable decisions and hope everything works out at the end.
.In divide and conquer we break down the problem into smaller problems and solve them.It
is difficult to come up with it.Also difficult to find out Time complexity of algorithms.
.But in greedy algorithm,very difficult to prove its correctness and it is often NOT correct even though it would be intutively correct.

Technique to Discover Greeedy Algorithm to any problem?
->Focus on special Cases of the problem and see how to minimize objective function:
Eg: for the Scheduling problem(E WjCj):
All jobs have same lengths but diff weights
All jobs have same weights but diff lengths.
