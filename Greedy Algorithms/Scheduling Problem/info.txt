Scheduling of n jobs using shared reseource.

Wi = Weight or importance of the job/process
Ci = Completion time of the job/process
Li = length of the job/process

Objective function : minimize the weighted sum of completion time or sum of WjCj.

Why choose greedy algorithm?
Greedy algorithm makes ITERATIVE myopic decision to yield hopefully optimal 
solution.

Scheduling is a SEQUENCING Problem with iterative spteps.Hence we use greedy algorithm.
Technique to Discover Greeedy Algorithm:
->Focus on special Cases of the problem and see how to minimize objective function:
Eg: for the Scheduling prsoblem(E WjCj):
All jobs have same lengths but diff weights
=>Hence more prority ones should be done earlier.
All jobs have same weights but diff lengths.
=>Hence shorter ones should be done earlier to prevent consquences on the later ones.

->Move to General Cases:
Ex:When jobs have high proirity and Long execution time.WHere shld they be placed?
A:For this we need to combine the two paramters into a single "Score" and use them.
When combining we need to note that:
.More the weight,more the priority,hence more should be the score.
.Less the length,less is execution time,hence more the score.
Hence the mathematical function to find the score should take f(Lj,Wj) and 
return a single Sj.
The functions can use "difference" or "ratio" ie:
*Case1:Wj/Lj and Case2:Wj-Lj.
Atleast one of them should be right between the fighting Algorithms.
Hence we need to rule out one of them using "Clever" inputs.
*Using the score values,we need to calculate the objective function WjCj value.
If W1=3 and Li=5 vs W2=1 and L2=2.For this,the scores are:
S11 = 3-5=-2,S12 = 1-2=-1 and S21 = 5/3 and S22 = 2/1.
*We consider the larger score for each case and compute the objective function
for that first:
->For the "diff" algorithm,S12 has larger score,hence we do : 1*2 + 3*(2+5) = 23
->For the "ratio" algo,S21 has larger score,hence we do : 3*5 + 1*(5+2) = 22
Since the "ratio" algo gives smaller input,we take that as the correct algorithm
