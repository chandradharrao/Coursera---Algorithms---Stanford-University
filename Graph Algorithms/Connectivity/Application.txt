*Time Complexity
->Each node is "looked at" atmost once and each edge is "looked at" atmost twice.Hence if Ns is the number of nodes from the starting vertex and Ms is the number of edges from the starting vertex s,then the time complexity is : O(Ns,Ms).

*We can use BFS to identify the components of a graph
*All nodes of a connected component are of equivlence class ie
->they are symmetric because if there is a path from u to v,then
there will be an path from v to u in undrected graph.

->they are transitive because if there is a pth from u to v and v to node w,
then there is a path from u to node w
->They are reflexive because every node has a path to itself.

*Uses:
->Airtel would want to check if a particular "subnet" of a network is connected so that
all nodes are reachable within it or not.
->Find the number of "subnets" within the huge "network" of networks.
->Set of closely related Objects can be clustered together Eg:closely related genome can be considwered as objects and theres an edge between them only f they are closely related.
Such similar cluster of nodes can be grouped into components.
